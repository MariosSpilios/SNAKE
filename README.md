# SNAKE
<p>Snake game in C using console</p>
<p></p>Just a basic snake game that i coded in C.</p> 
<p>I wanted to test the knowledge that i got from the first semester of my university in C.</p>
<p>If you wanna know how the code works look at the comments in the source code</p>
<p>Future versions:<br>1. Add obstacles.<br>2. Add themes for the player.<br>3. Maybe try to add levels<br>4. Multiplayer locally using 2 players and i also might try to make it client - server to play remotely with your friends</p>
