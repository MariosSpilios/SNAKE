# SNAKE
<p>Snake game in C using console</p>

<p></p>Just a basic snake game that i coded in C.</p> 

<p>I wanted to test the knowledge that i got from the first semester of my university in C.</p>

<p>If you wanna know how the code works look at the comments in the source code</p>

<p>## Future versions:<br>1. Add obstacles.<br>2. Add themes for the player.<br>3. Maybe try to add levels<br>4. Multiplayer locally using 2 players and i also might try to make it client - server to play remotely with your friends.</p>

<p>If you wanna try the game, download the .exe and the high_score.txt file and add them into a single directory and run the .exe.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p><br>
